The github repository mirrors the contents of a Google-internal repository for
Managed Certificates in GKE. The changes go through the internal repository and
from there are pushed to github. Because of that external pull request cannot
be directly merged to the github master, however you are welcome to suggest
improvements and fixes to any errors you may find here. Thanks for helping
develop Managed Certificates in GKE!
