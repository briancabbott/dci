## generate configurations
configurations in this folder is generated by the `stable-master` overlay from [pd-csi repo](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gcp-compute-persistent-disk-csi-driver/tree/master/deploy/kubernetes/overlays/stable-master).

## maintenance
every time the container image versions from the stable-master is bumped, the corresponding versions in this folder should be changed accordingly. specifically, `pd-csi.yaml` contains specification for driver running on nodes while containers running in `pdcsi-controller` can be found in `pdcsi-controller.yaml` under [cluster/gce/manifests/](https://github.com/kubernetes/cloud-provider-gcp/tree/master/cluster/gce/manifests)
